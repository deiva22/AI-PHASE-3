Creating a complete earthquake prediction model is a complex task that goes beyond a simple code example. Earthquake prediction is a challenging scientific problem, and it involves analyzing a variety of data sources and employing sophisticated machine learning techniques. Here, I'll provide you with a basic outline of how you can build a simple earthquake prediction model using Python, but please note that this model will not be highly accurate and should be considered for educational purposes only.

For earthquake prediction, you can use data related to seismic activity, such as earthquake magnitudes, depths, and geographic locations. Additionally, you can incorporate other relevant data like historical seismic activity, fault lines, and geological data.

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Obtain historical earthquake data from reliable sources like the US Geological Survey (USGS) or other earthquake monitoring organizations.
   - Collect data on features such as latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude, and date/time of each earthquake.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
   - Convert date/time information into a usable format.
   - Normalize or scale the data as needed.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features from the data, such as distance from known fault lines, historical seismic activity in the area, and geological data.

4. **Split the Data**:
   - Split your data into training and testing sets. This allows you to evaluate your model's performance.

5. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm. You can start with a simple model like a regression model, and later experiment with more complex models.
   - Train your model on the training data.

Here's a simple example of a Python code snippet for a basic regression model using scikit-learn:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Assuming you have a feature matrix X and a target vector y
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Consider other evaluation metrics specific to the problem, such as the ability to predict earthquake occurrences within a certain geographic region or time frame.

Remember, this is just a simplified example. Real-world earthquake prediction models require much more complex data, extensive feature engineering, and advanced machine learning techniques. Additionally, earthquake prediction remains a challenging and active area of research with ongoing developments.
